# GIIM
A weird text/image editor that looks vaguely like VIM. You can type a filename as you run the script to open the image directly, 
otherwise push control+o to open a document.

## Supported formats
GIIM currently supports saving and loading in

* [BIMG](https://github.com/SkyTheCodeMaster/bimg)
* [BBF](https://github.com/9551-Dev/BLBFOR)
* GIIM - incredibly large internal file format, currently offers no advantage over either of the other 2 formats.

The format used is determined solely by the file extension.
